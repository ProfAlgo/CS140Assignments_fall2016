# CS140Assignments_fall2016

Used for upload homework requirements for CS140 Algorithms class.

## File Structures

One folder (named HomeworkX) for each homework. Each homework may contain a detail description for hand-writing questions, a README file for basic coding instructions and starting code for each coding exercise.

For example:
- HomeworkX
-- HWX.pdf              ``` \\ Detail description of each question ```
-- README.md            ``` \\ Basic instructions for coding exercise and API spec ```
-- Starting codes       ``` \\ API spec ```

## Basic Usage

You can create your own branch on the repo to finish your homework. 

For coding exercise, please send your code to [algorithms_fall2016@outlook.com](mailto:algorithms_fall2016@outlook.com) with subject **CS140HW*X_YourStudentID_YourName***.

For hand-writing questions please 

For grading detatils:
We'll give out the test code and data after grading, if you have any question you can raise your arguments on **Issues**.

**You can create your own branch based on the repo, make changes on your own branch and create pull request. Any useful suggestion will be treated with a bonus.**

Thanks for joining us on CS140.
